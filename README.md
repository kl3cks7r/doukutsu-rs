# Cave Story Archipelago

This is a current work-in-progress Archipelago Multiworld (https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) implementation for the game Cave-Story. It's entirely based on the
doukutsu-rs project which can be found here: https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs

I'm also using the Archipelgo Rust library made by ryanisaacg, found here: https://github.com/ryanisaacg/archipelago_rs

### Planned supported game editions

I plan to primarily support the freeware version of the game, though ample testing has been done on the Cave Story+ data

**Important notes:**

- Stay away from the Switch and Android builds, those aren't tested and I'm not even sure if they would work.
- doukutsu-rs creates saves locally. This mod creates separate saves
